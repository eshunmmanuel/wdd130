            Hello! My name is Emmanuel, and I am from Ghana. I'm studying Web Development and Design at BYU, and
            I'm excited to learn how to build dynamic and accessible websites.
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy designing and listening to gospel music. I hope to
            use the skills I learn in this course to become a software developer.

            Ghana is a nation in West Africa known as the 'Gateway to Africa.' It is celebrated for its warm
            hospitality,
            vibrant culture, and historical significance, including its role in the global gold and cocoa industries.
            The capital,
            Accra, is a bustling coastal city and a hub for technology and commerce.
